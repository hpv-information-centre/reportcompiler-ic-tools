Getting started
===============

The Report Compiler IC Tools package pretends to assist in the generation of fragments using the Report Compiler library with HPV Information Centre reports. For this purpose it provides the utilities described below.

This library is currently under heavy development so at this time the architecture might change at any time until considered sufficiently mature. It will not be ready for production until significant, real-world usage shows shortcomings/limitations to be considered for potential architecture redesign.

This library is being developed by the ICO/IARC Information Centre on HPV and Cancer and will be used in our internal report generation tasks.

Summary
-------

To easily generate table artifacts in a document, with the referencing structure of the HPV Information Centre, see :ref:`tables`.

Following up on the table generation, the :ref:`markers` section describes how the markers for the different types of references are generated.

To generate customizable map plots, see :ref:`maps`.
