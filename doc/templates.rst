Jinja2 LaTeX templates
======================

This module includes jinja2 templates for common LaTeX artifacts such as tables or figures, that can be used by the report compiler library by setting the ``RC_TEMPLATE_LIBRARY_PATH`` to this project's ``templates`` path. These templates use the functionality provided by the generate_table_data function. There are currently two templates:

Table
-----

Generates a LaTeX table with the provided data. It requires a context with the following keys:

* **data**: Table data, as returned by the *generate_table_data* function.
* **columns**: Column data, as returned by the *generate_table_data* function.
* **footer**: Footer data (date strings and references), as returned by the *generate_table_data* function.
* **caption**: Table caption.

Figure
-------

Generates a LaTeX figure. It requires the following context keys:

* **image_path**: Path of the image file generated by the source code. It should usually be in the *fig* subdirectory.
* **footer**: Footer data, as in the table template above.
* **image_width**: (Optional) Fraction of the page text width the image should take. It is 1 by default.
